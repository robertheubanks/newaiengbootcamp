        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2023-12-31\\nTitle: Viz: A QLoRA-based Copyright Marketplace for Legally Compliant Generative AI\\nAuthors: Dipankar Sarkar\\nSummary: This paper aims to introduce and analyze the Viz system in a comprehensive\\nway, a novel system architecture that integrates Quantized Low-Rank Adapters\\n(QLoRA) to fine-tune large language models (LLM) within a legally compliant and\\nresource efficient marketplace. Viz represents a significant contribution to\\nthe field of artificial intelligence, particularly in addressing the challenges\\nof computational efficiency, legal compliance, and economic sustainability in\\nthe utilization and monetization of LLMs. The paper delineates the scholarly\\ndiscourse and developments that have informed the creation of Viz, focusing\\nprimarily on the advancements in LLM models, copyright issues in AI training\\n(NYT case, 2023), and the evolution of model fine-tuning techniques,\\nparticularly low-rank adapters and quantized low-rank adapters, to create a\\nsustainable and economically compliant framework for LLM utilization. The\\neconomic model it proposes benefits content creators, AI developers, and\\nend-users, delineating a harmonious integration of technology, economy, and\\nlaw, offering a comprehensive solution to the complex challenges of today's AI\\nlandscape.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-02-08\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention.
